      text: There when you need it, and out of the way when you don't!  The compact and modular design allows for easy attachment/detatchment from the kayak.  At less than 15lbs, this is the lightest and most powerful kayak drive system ever.

      date: 2010
      title: Our Humble Beginnings
      text: We started our careers as classmates and became business partners.  After one of our wives got caught in an outgoing tide on a kayk, we felt that there had to be a better solution in case kayakers got stuck in a similar situation.  Beyond safety, we wanted our design to be modular, light, easy to use and it had to fit on any kayak in the market.

      title: An Agency is Born
      text: BubblesTech was initally founded as a consulting firm to help companies who needed surge resources to finish out project that were in some sort of trouble.  We were never called in because things were going super well, but rather, because they were in tough shape!  Becasue of this, we have a deep bench of knowledge when it comes to electronics and product design!
