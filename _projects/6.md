The Hydra features a totally modular, custom designed LiPo battery to provide the torque, power and battery life you want!  At crusing speeds, a 5 1/2 hour battery life is a minimum specification that we set out to achieve and succeeded.

The battery is completely removable and swappable by the user either on or off the water (Get two in case the fish aren't biting for most of the afternoon!).

The battery itself is ~7lbs which is 1/5th the weight of a conventional marine battery that doesn't come close to the useable life that our Hydra power cell battery system is able to provide.

Fully waterproof with numerous safety interlocks, our Hydra battery system will keep you safe and keep you moving for hours!
