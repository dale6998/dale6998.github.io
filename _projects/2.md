Our system is designed to ~90% of kayaks that exist in the market today.  This means that the old kayak in your garage can get new life within minutes and be back on the water again!  You don't need any specialized kayak designs with holes cut in the deck or a highly specific style of kayak in order to make it fit.  It probably already fits out of the box!
