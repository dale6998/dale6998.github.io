The sinking feeling of falling out of a Kayak in rough waters or even in seemingly calm waters is a major concern for kayakers safety.

The Hydra system features a number of safety features that make the unit itself safe and also make the kayak itself safe in the event of an accident.

It's IP67 rating and waterproof design means that the unit is safe for the water in case of a tip over event, and it's safety interlocks means that if you fall out of the craft, it's advanced GPS hold features will actively keep the kayak in place instead of drifting away when things go wrong.
