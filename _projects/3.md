With the Hydra system, you can use the system when you need it for going fast with the push of a joystick, autopiloting to your favorite spot on the water and as a paddle assist when needed.  When you don't want they thrusters in your way, the whole unit folds up like a suitcase and gets out of your way.  This allows you to shoot rapids without fear of damaging the system, or it makes it easy to get back to fishing once you are where you want to be without having to worry about getting tangled in a lower-unit like other permanent propulsion systems.  

It's there when you need it, and it's out of the way when you don't!
