Our Mechanical Engineering design team is the best in class.  With years of design experience with dynamic solid structures and material deisgn, the Hydra clocks in at less than 15lbs with it's 5 1/2 hour battery installed!  The structural material will stand up to the tough conditions of marine environments including salt water and lake/river environments without breaking your back!

It's modular design allows you to easily remove batteries for charging after a long day and it's folding armature structure takes only a second to engage or disengage from the water to get you moving or fishing in no time at all!
